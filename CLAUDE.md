# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

This is the documentation site for the **Southern New England Industrial Training and Assessment Center (ITAC)**. It is a static site built with **Zensical** (a MkDocs-based system), configured via `zensical.toml`. Content lives in `docs/` as Markdown files. Pushing to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `zensical build --clean` and deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (Python venv already at .venv/)
pip install zensical

# Serve locally with live reload
zensical serve

# Build the static site
zensical build --clean
```

## Content Structure

All content is in `docs/`. The nav tree is **explicitly defined** in `zensical.toml` — adding a new `.md` file does **not** automatically add it to the site; it must be listed under `nav` in `zensical.toml`.

Key sections:
- `docs/Recommendations/` — Energy efficiency recommendation pages, organized by category (Compressed Air, HVAC, Motors, Lighting, Miscellaneous, Utility, Smart Manufacturing). Each page documents a specific measure's savings calculation methodology.
- `docs/Training/` — Modular training content on energy assessment topics.
- `docs/calculators/` — Interactive calculator pages (use Plotly/Chart.js for charts).
- `docs/plotme/` — PlotME tool documentation.
- `docs/handbook/` — Student handbook (onboarding, pay, advancement).
- `docs/Report Guidance/` — Guidance for writing assessment reports.
- `docs/assets/stylesheets/extra.css` — Site-wide custom CSS.

## Writing Recommendation Pages

When writing or editing a page in `docs/Recommendations/`, follow the structure and style conventions in `docs/Recommendations/TEMPLATE.md` and `docs/Recommendations/how-to.md`.

Key conventions:
- **Fixed 5 sections** for written recommendations (delivered as LaTeX in reports): Summary, Current Practices and Observations, Recommended Action, Anticipated Savings, Costs and Payback.
- The **methodology pages** (in `docs/Recommendations/`) document the *how-to* for each measure type — they use LaTeX math (`$$...$$`), Markdown tables, and optional Plotly/Chart.js charts. They are *not* themselves recommendations; they explain how to calculate savings for a given measure.
- Prefer charts over tables when data spans a range; use Markdown tables only for ≤3 rows with no visual story.
- Use `??? note "..."` for collapsible supplemental content, `!!! note "..."` / `!!! warning "..."` for admonitions.
- LaTeX math is rendered via MathJax (configured in `zensical.toml`).
- `hide: - toc` frontmatter suppresses the right-side table of contents on a page.

## Adding Pages

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate `docs/` subdirectory.
2. Add it to the `nav` list in `zensical.toml` — otherwise it will not appear in the site.
3. Images go in `docs/assets/` (or a `ReferencePhotos/` subfolder); reference with relative paths.

## Recommendation Page Style Guide

### Page Structure

Every recommendation page must follow this section order:

1. **Intro paragraph** — inline, no `## Overview` heading. One short paragraph describing the measure and why it saves energy.
2. **`**ARC Code(s):**`** line — immediately after the intro, before any sections.
3. **`## Savings Calculation`** — always this heading, not "Calculation Methodology" or similar.
   - `### Annual Energy Savings` — if the calculation is complex enough to need a subsection.
   - `### Peak Demand Savings` — always a separate subsection, never inline.
4. **`## Anticipated Costs`**
5. **`## Report Requirements`** — only when the measure requires a summary table in the report.

Do not use a `## Required Information` section. Any required inputs belong in the intro paragraph or the savings calculation prose.

### Calculation Order

Within the savings calculation, always calculate in this order:

1. **kWh** (annual energy savings)
2. **kW** (peak demand reduction — instantaneous, no seasonal split needed here)
3. **kW-months** (annual demand savings) — always a separate equation multiplying kW by months:

$$
\Delta kW\text{-months} = (\Delta kW_{\text{summer}} \times 3) + (\Delta kW_{\text{winter}} \times 9)
$$

This explicit equation makes the 3/9 month split self-documenting; no admonition or prose explanation is needed.

### Variable Naming

| Quantity | Variable |
|---|---|
| Annual energy savings | `\Delta kWh` (with descriptive subscript if needed) |
| Peak demand reduction | `\Delta kW_{\text{summer}}`, `\Delta kW_{\text{winter}}` |
| Annual demand savings | `\Delta kW\text{-months}` |

- Never use `\Delta E`, `\Delta Q`, `E_{\text{savings}}`, or `P_{\text{savings}}` for energy/demand savings.
- Subscript words always use `\text{}`: `_{\text{summer}}`, `_{\text{loaded}}`, `_{\text{repaired}}`.
- Unit abbreviations in variable identifiers (kWh, kW) are left unformatted — do not wrap them in `\text{}`.

### Where-Lists

After every equation, list variables in a bullet list. Always include parenthetical units at the end of each line:

```
- $\Delta kWh$ = annual energy savings (kWh/yr)
- $H$ = annual operating hours (hrs/yr)
- $\Delta kW_{\text{summer}}$ = summer peak demand reduction (kW)
```

Use consistent abbreviations throughout: `kWh/yr`, `kW`, `kW-months`, `hrs/yr`, `$/yr`.

### Admonitions

Use admonitions only when content is genuinely non-obvious or a common costly mistake — not to restate prose already on the page.

| Type | When to use | Collapsible? |
|---|---|---|
| `??? note "Title"` | Methodology choices that might surprise a reader (e.g., why a default value was chosen, derivation of a formula) | Yes — always collapsible |
| `!!! note "Assumptions"` | Assumptions the engineer must state in their analysis | No |
| `!!! warning "Title"` | Errors of omission with real cost consequences (e.g., forgetting rebates, replacing equipment before end-of-life) | No |

Do not use admonitions to restate content already explained in the surrounding prose or where-list.

### Anticipated Costs

Use bold subheadings (`**Equipment:**`, `**Installation:**`) only when both categories are present and have meaningfully different cost drivers. For simple cases, a single paragraph is sufficient.
